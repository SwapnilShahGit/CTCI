/**
 * 
 * Problem: You have a stack of n boxes, with width Wi, height Hi, and depth Di.
 * The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of one another if
 * each each box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in width,
 * height, and depth. Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest
 * possible stack. The height of a stack is the sum of the heights of each box.
